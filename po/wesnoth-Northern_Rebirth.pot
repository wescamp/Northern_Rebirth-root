Little did they suspect that their struggle would be the hinge of great events that might either restore the Northlands to the glory they had once known, or doom them to an eternity of bloody chaos."

I especially would like to thank Xandar86, Jetryl and Battlesquid for doing specific portraits for this campaign. For the translations, I would like to thank torangan, and scott for helping me set them up, Placid for the British-English, Belchion for the German, and Luciano for the Italian translations. My thanks also go to West for the music he has composed for this campaign. Special thanks also to Eric S. Raymond (ESR) for prose-doctoring the story-line and dialogue (version 1.17 and onward) and the otherwise tremendous amount of help and inspiration he has given me. Thank you also to all the members of the Wesnoth community who have given valuable feedback or helped whenever I got stuck with the code."

msgid "Long ago, far to the north of Wesnoth, and hard by the dwarven caves of Knalga, was a thriving mixed community known as Dwarven Doors. Food, wood, and cloth from all over Wesnoth and many elvish lands as well were brought here to be sold to the dwarves, while ores, metals and worked dwarven manufactures were bought here to be traded throughout the surface nations. Dwarves and humans worked and lived side by side; even the elves who came to trade mingled more with the other kindred races than was common elsewhere. Dwarven Doors grew populous and wealthy."

The people who called it home, dwarven and human alike, knew that the wealth of their city might arouse envy from afar -- but they kept their weapons sharp, and reckoned themselves well able to fight off any bandit gang or petty warlord that could arise in the thinly-settled northlands."

Then there arose a great warlord among the Bloody Sword tribe, the chieftain called Khazg Black-Tusk; and he raised an army, and beseiged Dwarven Doors."

msgid "It was a time of doom and great deeds, of fire and blood and slaughter.  The men and dwarves of the city fought valiantly. But there were always, it seemed, more orcs to replace the slain, while the defenders could find no succour.  Pleas for help went unheeded in other lands, for they were far away and fealt unthreatended by the orcs, and were wrapped up in their own affairs and struggles."

The dwarves were pushed back into the caverns of Knalga, while the humans of Dwarven Doors who survived the sack were enslaved by the orcs. Cut off from contact with the surface, the dwarves of Knalga fought on, but knew their utter subjugation could not be averted forever."

His father was a weaponsmith, his family used less brutally than most because the orcish masters put more value on that craft. In secret, his mother even taught him letters.  As the boy grew to young manhood, he could touch blades, and dream.  And he did."
