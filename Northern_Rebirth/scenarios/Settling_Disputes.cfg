	[story]
		[part]
		story= _ "Thus Tallin and his men made an orderly withdraw into the caves with the orcs right behind them."

		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "The dwarves were more then ready for them however and as soon as the humans got though the defenses the well prepared dwarves fell on the already bloodied orcs."
		background=orcattack.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "The battle raged on as wave after wave of orcs crashed onto the dwarven defenses and shattered."
		background=orcattack.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "As the battle raged on Tallin again made council with Hamel."

		[/part]
	
		[part]
		story= _ "So how did it go?"
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "It was fierce and bloody. We fought them for four days and three nights with no end in sight. Every time we killed an orc it seemed that two more would take his place. One thing is for sure, we can't win like this."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "So you withdrew. Wise decision. Our prepared defenses will be able to hold the orcs of far longer and with less losses then you would have been able to do in the open field. I see that my training has had an affect on you."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "No doubt, but what should we do from here? The number of humans and dwarves is limited, unlike the orcs whose numbers seem unlimited."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "It's true.  However without crushing the orcish host we will never be able to reach any long term solution."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Orcs are fickle and if we negotiate a treaty with them - assuming they will accept - it will just be broken as soon as the next orcish warlord rises."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Then what shall we do? Can we assassinate this Rakshas fellow somehow and throw them into disarray once more." 
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "That will be very difficult. We did that last time and they will no doubt be alert to that threat now. Anyway, it is just a temporary solution. Soon another strong leader will arise and we will be faced with the same problem."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Well, back to the drawing board. What should we do?"
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "I think we should try to gather more allies somehow. That way we can engage them on multiple fronts, or divide them into smaller groups, or cut them off from their supplies. The possibilities are endless." 
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Wise words, but who is there in these wild Northlands that would help us?" 
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "You can count the Elves out. They are a selfish lot, only interested in themselves. They would only help us if something drastic happened to them and they needed our help. What about Wesnoth?"
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Wesnoth is to far away and we have no idea what political state they are in."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]
		[part]
		story= _ "The last thing we heard about them was years ago when Price Konrad passed through here. At that time the evil queen Asheviere was ruling and it was said that she was in alliance with the orcs."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "And then that Princess Li'sar was in hot pursuit of Konrad as well. I wonder whatever happened to them."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "The last time any dwarf set eyes on Konrad was when he set out to the eastern tunnels in search of the Scepter of Fire so he could claim his place as ruler."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]
	
		[part]
		story= _ "Geez, what a fool's quest. Everyone in these Northlands knows that the Scepter is long gone."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "But anyhow we're getting off track here. Where can we find allies in these wild Northlands?"
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Tallin, before I was captured by Malfor, I used to be in contact with a powerful magician called Ro'Arthian and his brother Ro'Sothian."
		background=Father_Marcus.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Ro'Arthian pah! Don't utter that cursed name!"
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Why Hamel, what is the story with him?"
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "I have heard all about him from my good friend Stalrag. He is - or was anyway, haven't heard from him in years - the chief of the villages that lay along the Mountain Pass." 
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Those foul mages have long terrorized him and his people."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Remember Hamel, there is always two sides to every story. How would you feel if say... the elves decided to come in and level Knalga so they can grow another big forest on top."
		background=Father_Marcus.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Those filthy elves! I'll...."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "See!"
		background=Father_Marcus.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "What were you doing keeping contact with mages such as those anyway? Trying to save their souls?"
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Hehe, something like that."
		background=Sister_Theta.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ " 'rolls eyes'"
		background=Father_Marcus.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "So anyway, what are you trying to say?"
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "I propose that we go to the mountain pass where they live and see what the situation is. If the wizards are still alive we might be able to persuade them to help us. What's more, if Stalrag is still around we could use his help too."
		background=Father_Marcus.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "I don't really see how just two mages can help us Father."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]
		
		[part]
		story= _ "They are not just two mages. They also have great control over creatures of the wild such as ogres, gryphons, and sometimes even trolls! How about having some of those on your side for once."
		background=Father_Marcus.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "That sounds really good. What do you think Hamel?"
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Hrmph. These are desperate times. If that lunatic of a mage will agree to help I guess we don't have any other choice."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Hey, we have had experiences with crazy mages ourselves. Believe me, they are dangerous! You will feel a lot better with some of them on your side." 
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Anyhow it looks like we are in agreement. Now how exactly do we get to this mountain pass?" 
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "And so Tallin and his party set out to secure the help of the mages."
