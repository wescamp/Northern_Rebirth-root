		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "As they approached they were met with a most welcome sight: New defenses, looking very much like the legendary impenetrable dwarvish defenses of old, had sprung up everywhere. All of them were manned by alert and well armed dwarves who hailed them boisterously. Upon reaching the mines themselves they were met by belches of smoke from the furiously working forges, heaps of new weapons and armor for humans and dwarves alike, and the deafening clang of hammers and picks from the dwarves forging weapons and mining the ore."

		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "They found Hamel in a forge hammering away at a new axe. He greeted them warmly and arrangements were quickly made for all their food and accommodations, as wall as care for the sick and wounded."

		[/part]

	
		[part]
		story= _ "All the woman and children had been brought from the original dwarvish keep.  While there was much grieving over the men who had died, they were all overjoyed to be together again."

		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "After everything had been taken care of the humans and dwarves once again made council."

		[/part]
	
		
		[part]

		[part]

		[part]
		story= _ "We have managed to clear the connecting tunnels to here and to the old keep as well as other parts of Knalga."
		background=Hamel.jpg

		[part]
		story= _ "It is slow and dangerous work, mostly due to the trolls. But it has been made easier because of the skeletons." 
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]
	

		[part]
		story= _ "They were fighting the trolls, but when you destroyed Malifor, they all just fell apart. So, there are many tunnels that are infested with nothing but piles of old bones."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "Great! How about the weapons and armor?"
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		
		[part]

		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "I didn't know that you dwarves knew swordplay. I thought you all fought with axes, hammers or those thunder weapons."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "Yes, it's true we do prefer our axes and hammers, but then again, we MAKE swords. If we really want to claim to be expert weapon-smiths we must also be expert at wielding the weapons we make."
		background=Hamel.jpg 
		[/part]

		[part]

		story= _ "That's great! So what is the price of your weapons? We have gathered much booty from Malifor's treasury and I am sure we will be able to pay you generously."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "PRICE!!! Don't insult us Tallin. You have done so much to help us dwarves - heck it's because of you that we have started rebuilding Knalga in the first place, so don't talk about price to us."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "But don't you need the gold to help rebuild Knalga? And we have plenty."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "Tallin, Knalga was an extremely rich nation. Malifor's treasury is hardly a fraction of the riches that we will find, and are finding every day now. So no!"

		[part]

		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "But anyhow, what I am saying is that you should learn these skills from me."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "I know you are really impressive with the pitchfork, and you are not half bad with that sword you picked up somewhere in the line - but really, get serious. It is high time you learned how to be a REAL leader of men."

		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]

		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "Thus, the humans rested for many days while they were equipped with new arms and armor and trained by the dwarves."
		
		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "However the peace was not to last. Early one morning Tallin (sore from head to foot from his traning) was startled awake by the blare or trumpets, the pounding of drums and the clash of steel as the humans and dwarves hurried to arm themselves."

		[part]
		story= _ "He hurriedly found Hamel who informed him that a massive host of orcs had arrived at the gates of the new Knalga."  

		[/part]

		
		[part]
		story= _ "After a quick council of war it was decided that the dwarves would reinforce the the inner defenses while Tallin and the humans sallied out and met them. If the humans couldn't stop them then they could always retreat into the caves."
